# CMIP6-extremeindices-biascorrection
- In this project, I had responsibility to conduct a bias-correction technique to provide high-resolution extreme climate indices information over eastern part of Indonesia (Nusa Tenggara and Papua Archipelago)
- As for the CMIP6 models, we retrived 3 models with several variants ('CESM2-WACCM', 'CNRM-ESM2-1', 'MPI-ESM1-2-LR')
- For data analysis purposes, this project uses two future scenarios: ScenarioMIP and GeoMIP.
